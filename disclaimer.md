## Disclaimer

This is my personal blog I use as a scratchpad to digitize my notes, ideas and opinions. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.

In addition, I consider myself a continuous learner and my thoughts and opinions will evolve over time.  This scratchpad is intended to be a semi-permanent point in time snapshot and manifestation of the various ideas running around my brain. 

However, I reserve the right for this content to be completely out-of-date as soon as soon as it is posted.
Use at your own risk.
