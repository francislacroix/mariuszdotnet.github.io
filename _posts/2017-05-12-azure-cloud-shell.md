Last week during Build 2017 Microsoft announced the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview) (Preview).

#Browser-based Shell Experience

Cloud Shell enables access to a browser-based command-line experience built with Azure management tasks in mind. Leverage Cloud Shell to work untethered from a local machine in a way only the cloud can provide.

My favororite feature is that you can actually have a stateful storage drive wthin Azure Store.

One thing I wanted to do after I was done playing was to reset my "clouddrive" so it's nice and clean. To do this inside cloud shell, run **`clouddrive unmount`** which will reset your account back and start from scratch.
